Website project for IS 2020 class
i am creating a database composed of three main models: user, recipe and food. recipe and foods are connected through a many-to-many relationship,
because a single food is connected to many recipes and a recipe uses many foods. I am trying to build the db and solve the issues i encounter by going on.
